Remove redundant `fn_identity` heartbeat tool and trim the inline Identity Snapshot to presence flags + content hashes. Full soul/instructions/memory content is already loaded in the system prompt's Custom Instructions section, so per-tick previews were duplicating multi-KB of context for no verification benefit. Saves prompt tokens on every heartbeat run.
